2682	milpay	Basic allowance for subsistence (BAS): BAS is meant to offset costs for a member's meals. This allowance is based in the historic origins of the military in which the military provided room and board (or rations) as part of a member's pay. This allowance is not intended to offset the costs of meals for family members.
Beginning on January 1, 2002, all enlisted members received full BAS, but paid for their meals (including those provided by the government). It was the culmination of the BAS reform transition period.

Because BAS is intended to provide meals for the service member, its level is linked to the price of food. Therefore, each year it is adjusted based upon the increase of the price of food as measured by the USDA food cost index. This is why the increase to BAS will not necessarily be the same percentage as that applied to the increase in the pay table, as annual pay raises are linked to the increase of private sector wages. As of 2010, enlisted members receive $323.87; warrant officers and commissioned officers receive $223.04 per month. As of 2018, commissioned officers receive $254.39 per month.

Enlisted BAS II. Enlisted members on duty at a permanent station and assigned to single (unaccompanied) government quarters, which do not have adequate food storage or preparation facilities, and where a government mess is not available and the government cannot otherwise make meals available, may be entitled to BAS II. The rate for BAS II is fixed at twice the rate for standard enlisted BAS. Effective February 10, 2006, the Navy authorized the payment of BAS II.

Overseas housing allowance (OHA) is BAH for servicemembers stationed OCONUS. This differs from BAH in that it reimburses actual housing costs below a certain amount, and therefore servicemembers cannot save any extra pay from this allowance.

7388	Added DV Customer	Department of the Air Force housing program officials are analyzing data from the recently completed 2020 Department of Defense Annual Tenant Satisfaction Survey for trends and ways to improve the enterprise’s privatized and government-owned housing portfolio and tenant experience. 

A private contractor distributed the survey to the DAF’s 68 privatized housing locations with an overall response rate of 30.1 percent. Overall, privatized housing projects scored an average rating of 77.2 in the survey, which concluded Feb. 5. The DAF’s target metric is 75 or higher. In 2019, the average satisfaction rate was 79.1.

This year’s results reflected more accurate data due to survey revisions. The lower score since last year is likely due to service and maintenance delays from COVID-19 precautionary measures taken by project owners, said Jennifer Miller, acting Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations, Environment and Energy.

7502	Added DV Customer	Department of the Air Force housing program officials are analyzing data from the recently completed 2020 Department of Defense Annual Tenant Satisfaction Survey for trends and ways to improve the enterprise’s privatized and government-owned housing portfolio and tenant experience. 

A private contractor distributed the survey to the DAF’s 68 privatized housing locations with an overall response rate of 30.1 percent. Overall, privatized housing projects scored an average rating of 77.2 in the survey, which concluded Feb. 5. The DAF’s target metric is 75 or higher. In 2019, the average satisfaction rate was 79.1.

This year’s results reflected more accurate data due to survey revisions. The lower score since last year is likely due to service and maintenance delays from COVID-19 precautionary measures taken by project owners, said Jennifer Miller, acting Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations, Environment and Energy.

The demonstration display, dubbed the Technology Lab, offered media a peek into the future at of one of the innovative technologies that will make Tyndall the Installation of the Future. The Installation Resilience Operations Center, or IROC, prototype is a game-changing solution for enhancing base security, emergency response and facility operations.

“The IROC effort lays the foundation for the Air Force to rapidly adopt new technologies for enhanced situational awareness and improved facility operations,” said Lowell Usrey, PMO Integration branch chief for the Air Force Civil Engineer Center’s Natural Disaster Recovery program. “It’s a transformative model for what agile methodologies and modern hybrid cloud technologies can achieve for the military.”	Civilian Pay CSR

10374	Elevated to Military Pay Manager	Air Force Recruiting Service and their partners at Richard Petty Motorsports and Ed Carpenter Racing introduced their newest paint scheme to honor the Tuskegee Airmen for the 2021 race season, April 20, 2021. The paint scheme is inspired by the Tuskegee Airmen’s P-51 Mustang used during World War II. The iconic red tail and the red and yellow stripes on the nose of the aircraft are prominent on the cars. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first black military aviators in the U.S. Army Air Corps, a precursor of the U.S. Air Force. Pilots, navigators, maintainers, bombardiers, instructors and support staff all trained at the Tuskegee Army Air Field, Ala. The Tuskegee Airmen flew more than 15,000 sorties during World War II in Europe and North Africa. (Courtesy image)	Military Pay Technician

13609	Elevated to Military Pay Manager	Development started under the "Advanced Technology Bomber" (ATB) project during the Carter administration; its expected performance was one of the President's reasons for the cancellation of the Mach 2 capable B-1A bomber. The ATB project continued during the Reagan administration, but worries about delays in its introduction led to the reinstatement of the B-1 program. Program costs rose throughout development. Designed and manufactured by Northrop, later Northrop Grumman, the cost of each aircraft averaged US$737 million (in 1997 dollars).[4] Total procurement costs averaged $929 million per aircraft, which includes spare parts, equipment, retrofitting, and software support.[4] The total program cost, which included development, engineering and testing, averaged $2.13 billion per aircraft in 1997.[4]	Military Pay Supervisor

14352	DAF releases FY22 budget proposal, journeys to the Air and Space Forces of 2030	The department’s $173.7 billion request includes the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force budgets. The Air Force’s budget of $156.3 billion is a 2.3% increase and the Space Force’s budget of $17.4 billion is a 13.1% increase from FY 2021.

“This budget starts us on the path necessary to organize, train, and equip the Air and Space Forces to deter and, if necessary, defeat the challenges we anticipate in 2030 and beyond,” said Acting Secretary of the Air Force John Roth. “It not only funds the capabilities required today, but also where the Department of the Air Force needs to make trade-offs to invest in the capabilities required for future competition.”

Key modernization programs funded in the budget proposal includes the: Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, the replacement for the aging Minuteman III; Next-Generation Air Dominance, the Air Force’s future air superiority capability; Advanced Battle Management System, the Department’s contribution to Joint All Domain Command and Control; and space-based capabilities such as the Next-Gen Overhead Persistent Infrared missile warning system.

Roth said the spending plan, in addition to capability-focused modernization, also advances the Department’s commitment to empowering Airmen and Guardians, connecting the Joint Force, and expanding partnerships.	Team Member

The week is set aside each year to honor all law enforcement officers – military and civilian – who have given their lives for our nation and their communities. In addition to honoring those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, we wanted to use this month to recognize the work of security forces members within the Air Force Security Forces Center, Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center headquarters and our detachments. Like Defenders who have gone before, they are paving the way for the next generation because of the work they are doing for installations to include funding, training and equipment.)

This is accomplished through both virtual and on-site continual evaluation assessments of over 80 security forces units, as well as data validation and analysis of major command inspector general findings.

17097	Air Force financial management	The Fiscal Year 2004 Financial Statements likewise reflects this evolution and efficiency. You will notice it
contains a more concise Management Discussion and Analysis section that more effectively summarizes the
great achievements of the Air Force over the past year. It also fulfills the requirements of the Chief
Financial Officer Act, documents the expenditures devoted to our General Fund and Working Capital
Fund (addressed in the accounting statements) and reviews selected performance measures established
as part of the Government Performance and Results Act.
America can be proud of the good stewardship of our resources provided by Air Force financial management
professionals. They are indeed supporting our nation by “financing the fight” with integrity,
selfless service, and excellence.	Customer

19518	Resolved	Interfund detail billing records are grouped together by sellers according to the buyer’s fund code in the Summary Billing Record, and are transmitted together via the DLMS 810L Logistics Bill (or equivalent legacy transactions) to seller and buyer Central Accounts Offices (CAO). For bills that pass DLA Logistics Management Standards Office prescribed Defense Automatic Addressing System (DAAS) edits, the seller CAO is authorized to report summary level funds transfer for seller reimbursement and buyer disbursement to Treasury (currently at the end of the month). No detail bills are sent to Treasury. This is a self-balancing process. The buyer’s CAO is responsible for Interfund bill clearance, ensuring that buyer disbursements are correctly reported. For the buyer, the bill is both a bill and a notice of funds withdrawn (payment) from his account. The buyer must accept a billing and may seek adjustment from the seller if needed. While buyer CAOs may adjust the disbursement side of the seller reported Interfund transactions, neither buyers nor their CAOs can adjust, either directly or indirectly, the reimbursement side of the Interfund transactions reported by seller CAOs.

21090	Elevated to Accounting Supervisor	In my career field, you see some levels where there are a lot of women but as you grow, sometimes there isn’t so many women. I love what I do and if I can set that example of the future generation coming up, that’s what I want to do. I think the best example is for us to be in the career field and show them it’s not just sitting behind a desk, it’s not just doing a business acumen … there are a lot of females graduating from college and deciding what it is they want to do … If I can be that role model to show them you can make a difference making us be a better stronger Air Force. They’re going to have to bring that innovation and creativity soon and I am all about making sure that I’m setting that example for the next generation.	Accounting Technician

21425	Assigned to Travel Pay Technician	A “post-post” issue involves accepting and updating records after the event (or issue) has occurred. DLA and the Components use post-post processing in various contexts, including high priority shipments requested through the DLA call center and procedures in support of maintenance operations. For DLA, one form of the post-post process includes the Directed Material Release Order (MRO) which may be entered by authorized personnel to direct release of materiel from a Distribution Standard System (DSS) storage site without prior ICP processing of the requisition. The customer initiating the requirement has no systemic interface with the system preparing the transaction to provide SLOA data content. When this process is used, the first transaction available is the DLMS 511R for the DLA Directed MRO (Requisition) (equivalent to DLA legacy C0A/C01) or DLA Directed MRO (Referral Order) (equivalent to DLA legacy CQA/CQ1). In other scenarios, the issue transaction is the first available DLMS transaction	Travel Pay Technician

21449	MyVector is one	MyVector is one of the many tools Airmen and Guardians can use to enhance their career development, including tracking personal development and assignments, writing performance evaluations, and connecting with mentors as well as mentoring others.Last summer, the Secretary of the Air Force stood up the Diversity and Inclusion task force to address the issue of racial, ethnic and other demographic disparities and their impact on the forces. The task force identified MyVector’s mentorship platform as an area that could help expand diversity efforts. Having more specific filters, such as race, ethnicity and disability, allows Airmen and Guardians to better tailor searches to their specific needs.	Customer

21734	Elevated to Lead Budget Analyst	The DoD Components have the use of land, buildings, and other facilities that are located overseas and that have been obtained through various international treaties and agreements negotiated by the Department of State. The DoD purchases overseas capital assets with appropriated funds, but the host country retains title to land and improvements. Generally, treaty terms allow the DoD Components continued use of these properties until the treaties expire. These fixed assets are subject to loss in the event treaties are not renewed or other agreements are not reached that allow for the continued use by the DoD Components. Therefore, if the U.S. can no longer use foreign bases because treaties or other agreements have been terminated, losses will be recorded for the value of any non-retrievable capital assets after negotiations between the U.S. and the host country determine the amount to be paid the U.S. for such capital investments.

21780	Responded	The DoD Components have the use of land, buildings, and other facilities that are located overseas and that have been obtained through various international treaties and agreements negotiated by the Department of State. The DoD purchases overseas capital assets with appropriated funds, but the host country retains title to land and improvements. Generally, treaty terms allow the DoD Components continued use of these properties until the treaties expire. These fixed assets are subject to loss in the event treaties are not renewed or other agreements are not reached that allow for the continued use by the DoD Components.

You will notice it contains a more concise Management Discussion and Analysis  section that more effectively summarizes the great achievements of the Air Force over the past year. It also fulfills the requirements of the Chief Financial Officer Act,  documents the expenditures devoted to our General Fund and Working Capital Fund (addressed in the accounting statements) and reviews selected performance measures established as part of the Government Performance and Results Act.

22916	Customer Action Required	The DoD Components have the use of land, buildings, and other facilities that are located overseas and that have been obtained through various international treaties and agreements negotiated by the Department of State. The DoD purchases overseas capital assets with appropriated funds, but the host country retains title to land and improvements. Generally, treaty terms allow the DoD Components continued use of these properties until the treaties expire. These fixed assets are subject to loss in the event treaties are not renewed or other agreements are not reached that allow for the continued use by the DoD Components. Therefore, if the U.S. can no longer use foreign bases because treaties or other agreements have been terminated, losses will be recorded for the value of any non-retrievable capital assets after negotiations between the U.S. and the host country determine the amount to be paid the U.S. for such capital investments.

The DoD purchases overseas capital assets with appropriated funds, but the host country retains title to land and improvements. Generally, treaty terms allow the DoD Components continued use of these properties until the treaties expire. These fixed assets are subject to loss in the event treaties are not renewed or other agreements are not reached that allow for the continued use by the DoD Components. Therefore, if the U.S. can no longer use foreign bases because treaties or other agreements have been terminated, losses will be recorded for the value of any non-retrievable capital assets after negotiations between the U.S. and the host country determine the amount to be paid the U.S. for such capital investments.

Planning and directing is "the determination of intelligence requirements, development of appropriate intelligence architecture, preparation of a collection plan, and issuance of orders and requests to information collection agencies" (JP 2-01, Joint and National Intelligence Support to Military Operations). These activities enable the synchronization and integration of collection, processing, exploitation, analysis, and dissemination activities/resources to meet information requirements of national and military decision-makers.

26096	None	Different Types of BAH
There are several types of BAH to satisfy various housing situations that occur among military members. In general, the amount of BAH you receive depends on your location, pay grade, and whether you have dependents. Under most circumstances, you receive BAH for the location where you are assigned, not where you live. Additionally, you may be entitled to some BAH amounts if you are residing separately from your dependents. This occurs in situations involving unaccompanied overseas tours or having a dependent child that resides with a former spouse. The rules regarding these situations can become quite complex. Consult your Finance Office if you are in one of these situations. Each type of BAH is described below.

BAH With Dependents and BAH Without Dependents
A member with permanent duty within the 50 United States, who is not furnished government housing, is eligible for Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), based on the member's dependency status at the permanent duty ZIP Code. A member stationed overseas, including U.S. protectorates, who is not furnished government housing, is eligible for Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) based on the member's dependency status. If a member is serving an UNACCOMPANIED overseas tour, the member is eligible for BAH at the "with dependents" rate, based on the dependent's US residence ZIP Code, plus OHA at the "without dependents" rate, if the member is not furnished government housing overseas.

Partial BAH
A member without dependents who is living in government quarters is entitled to a Partial BAH.

BAH Reserve Component/Transit (BAH RC/T)
BAH RC/T is a non-locality housing allowance for members in particular circumstances, for example, reservists on active duty for 30 or fewer days. It also applies when a member is in transit from selected areas where no prior BAH rate exists (such as overseas). It does not vary by geographic location. BAH RC/T was set based on the old Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ), which was based on the national average for housing. BAH RC/T is published annually and is determined by increasing the previous year's rates by the national average percentage growth of housing costs.

BAH-Differential (BAH-Diff)
BAH-Diff is the housing allowance amount for a member who is assigned to single-type quarters and who is authorized a basic allowance for housing solely by reason of the member's payment of child support. A member is not entitled to BAH-Diff if the monthly rate of that child support is less than the BAH-Diff. BAH-Diff is determined by the SECDEF and was equal to the difference between BAQ with dependents and BAQ without dependents in 1997 for the member's grade. BAH-Diff is published annually and is determined by increasing the previous year's rates by the percentage growth of military basic pay. For more information contact your finance office.

26266	Added DV Customer	Allowances are the second most important element of military pay. Allowances are moneys provided for specific needs, such as food or housing. Monetary allowances are provided when the government does not provide for that specific need. For example, the quantity of government housing is not sufficient to house all military members and their families. Those who live in government housing do not receive full housing allowances. Those who do not live in government housing receive allowances to assist them in obtaining commercial housing.

The most common allowances are Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) and Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). A majority of the force receives both of these allowances and, in many cases, these allowances comprise a significant portion of the member's total pay.	Military Pay Technician

27699	What do you love about your job? Being an internal DAF business consultant and solving complex mission challenges. Senior leaders and subject matter experts point us in the direction	What do you love about your job?
Being an internal DAF business consultant and solving complex mission challenges. Senior leaders and subject matter experts point us in the direction of what’s “eating their lunch” and we get to systematically dissect, analyze and present tailored strategies to fix the issues. By employing CM as a problem-solving tool, we truly embody the Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center’s motto, “your success is our mission.” 

Our CM recommendations help close observed gaps in data, processes, performance, cost and management strategies. A huge benefit of our CM process is the identification of highly relevant industry best practices, benchmarks, emerging technology and innovation. 
To obtain those external data points, we engage regularly with Fortune 50 companies such as Amazon and UPS. It's enlightening to understand industry’s perspective and then bring it back within the fence line to help improve how the DAF does business. And of course, my team is amazing, so that doesn’t hurt!

When it comes to your job, what keeps you motivated?
A key objective of DAF CM is shifting from a budget execution mindset (i.e., spending our money on time, regardless of mission criticality) to strategic cost management (i.e., bettering overall costs to maximize investments in our most vital capabilities). Seeing the attributable mission improvements and cost savings associated with this paradigm shift is extremely rewarding. It’s that return on investment that keeps me motivated.    

Why are you and your team important to the Air Force/Space Force enterprise/your customers?
Our Air Force and Space Force missions continue to grow, but our budgets rarely keep pace. Understanding how to “keep the lights on” while looking to “turn on new lights” can be challenging without the right decision intelligence. Through CM’s robust process, we are equipping senior leaders with decision-quality data and recommendations to help optimize operations and get more mission capability for their budget. As a result of our CM initiatives, we’ve analyzed over $7.6 billion in DAF/Department of Defense requirements and identified more than $1.4 billion in cost savings and avoidances. 

Describe a project/event you and your team worked on recently that gave you a great sense of accomplishment:
The standup of the DAF Land Mobile Radio Product Management Office within AFIMSC’s Installation Directorate has been a personal CM career highlight. The genesis for that new team was a Category Intelligence Report I authored for LMR. That data-driven decision was ultimately approved by the Under Secretary of the Air Force. 
In addition to standing up the LMR PMO, the LMR CIR recommended new inventory policies and enterprise acquisitions to help normalize costs, influence demand, standardize requirements and address interoperability and cybersecurity risks. One of those acquisition recommendations, Enterprise Land Mobile Radio, was just awarded by the 771st Enterprise Sourcing Squadron to address LMR infrastructure sustainment. The collective LMR CIR recommendations are slated to save the DAF over $300 million. 

How does what you do support AFIMSC’s strategic priorities?
Category management is now a core competency of the Air Force Installation Contracting Center which should help integrate this business practice into the operational acquisition community. Specifically, CM is supporting increasing lethality and readiness and pursuing organizational excellence. Our CM projects focused on IT, facilities and base operations help improve performance and optimize costs to enable more resilient, mission-capable installations. Additionally, at its core, CM is about innovation and data-driven decision making, which drive many of goals within organizational excellence. There are certainly synergies between the DAF CM Program and AFIMSC’s Strategic Plan.  

Is there anything else you’d like to add which might help people understand the importance of what you do for the Department of the Air Force?
CM is a federally mandated initiative focused on delivering value through improved requirements and enterprise strategies. The DAF is considered the CM thought leader within the federal government and is routinely sought after for our business intelligence and CM best practices. Given the substantial mission return on investment opportunity, our long-term vision for CM is to fully integrate it into the DAF’s everyday business operations.

“It was great to provide on-site support to our warfighters and get out from behind the desk,” he said. “It was very gratifying and a learning experience working with our host-nation partners. The lessons learned from this unique opportunity will be forever invaluable to me.”	Customer

AFRC Travel Pay Manager
29112	Resolved	Good Afternoon,If there is anything that needs to be added/updated to the LOA then it would need to be amended on your orders. The airfare receipts will suffice but the main issue would be the Line of Accounting. I would recommend getting your orders amended and adding the LOA you provided below. Unfortunately if we were to resubmit this voucher they would return it again for Line of Accounting issues. Osan AB will be able to amend your orders and resubmit your voucher to pay the remaining expenses even if they are unable to access your pay record.	Military Pay Technician

29139	N/A	Page 1 of the attached reporting instructions “Travel Order guidelines WMGT 101-22B” states &quot;No government meals are available or directed while at WPAFB&quot;. However, students had to purchase MREs' for $80 (out of pocket) for a seven-day period (4 Dec - 10 Dec 2021) while in the field (Officer Field Education) at Tyndall AFB (See Page 10). The $80 expense is also listed in the attached DD Form 1351-2. Will the attached travel voucher (DD Form 1351-2) suffice or do I need to submit an additional one?Additionally, see attached “CE Per Diem Policy Letter” dated JUL 21 from the CE School Dean that reads “all students TDY to the Civil Engineer School will be entitled to full per diem rate” because of a lack of transportation to dining facilities, excessive distance between dining facilities, place of duty, and lodging.  Please note dining facilities were also closed due to COVOD-19 restrictions.V/R,Major Defay	Customer
29140	N/A	JTR 020304 D.2c reads as follows&#58;A dining facility is considered not available&#58;c.

(2) There is excessive distance between the Government dining facility and places of duty or lodging.The attached “CE Per Diem Policy Letter dated JUL 21 from the CE School Dean” also meets the requirements of JTR 020304 D.2c and provides justification for full per diem. As such, do I still need to submit an additional 1351-2 that includes a statement from the AO annotating Meals and Incidentals are approved based on JTR 020304 D.2C? That sounds redundant to me.

The Net Pay is $35217.66 but the debt remains at $49392.83. I have been taxed on it $7582.32. Since I already paid taxes on this 4.5 months of income, I am now being double taxed.1. When well the debt collection start and at what rate from my income?2. since $7582.32 in taxes has been deducted from the lump payment, but $49392.83 is still be collected, DFAS will be collecting more than it paid me out. How will that taxed amount be returned me (since I am being double taxed)? 3. When will I see my leave balance restored? I am missing 12-13 days.	Customer

Please contact the appropriate IMA office and resubmit your claim for reimbursement.&quot; (From document, &quot;Lt. Col Carlton Memo Case 21-030&quot;)The memo says you guys are supposed to issue the reimbursement for my situation.  They had at least one attorney examiner at DOHA make this determination based on a JA opinion.  (From document, &quot;Remand Letter&quot;)What is the hold up here?Are you guys questioning the direction of the offices of DOHA and DFAS?   Do you have a different legal and policy expertise that overrides their determination?  Why does AFRC, DFAS, and DoD have a delineated appeals process for these issues if you guys are going to ignore it when they tell you what to do?  And if you really need to see the JA Opinion, why are you guys reaching out to them for it?	Customer

If you open a CMS case now, will that have DFAS collect all the money back at once, or will it still just come slowly out of each paycheck as it is likely to anyway? I'm not sure I understand what a CMS case will do for the situation now (I do think it would have been helpful back in March when the problem first arose). I will seek the advice of the 610 FM and see if they advise an additional CMS case.	Customer

29711	N/A	According to this pdf , I must "Contact your local FSO to propose a repayment schedule that is acceptable to the Air Force, and complete a signed, voluntary repayment agreement (included)."  I think you probably should have mentioned this directly rather than "please read for repayment options" as it states that I must coordinate repayment through YOU. The first option on the letter is "1. _____ Deduct the total amount from my military pay in one (1) Pay period" and this is the one I would like to select. However, how is this option even possible because of how great the debt you initiated is?  I need this debt paid off ASAP as it was supposed to be deducted immediately when you put you lump sum in my account (but it wasn't)	Customer

29713	Reopened	Per the letter I uploaded, flight crew training is supposed to receive partial per diem because the chow hall is not always available to due to our flying schedule.	Customer

29716	N/A	This image shows in DCPS how after returning to duty  after Jan 21, DCPS changed my RG days to KG.	Customer
29717	N/A	DCPS fix did not take. I have added the image screenshots from DCPS showing what days are affected. My RTD was 22Jan22. The days showing KG/LA in DCPS are AFTER my return which are incorrect.  446 FSS/FSC recommends CPTS open a Remedy Ticket w/ DFAS for correction.	Customer
29718	BAH is incorrect	I am on PCS orders so I am entitled to BAH at Fort Meade rate. However, starting with the May 27 LES, you have changed my rate to be zip code 84078, which is incorrect. This will need to be corrected for both (2) May pay periods. Correct BAH per pay period is $1317, which was correct on previous LES this FY, but is now wrong. Again, my PCS orders for 365 MPA approve me for Fort Meade BAH. Please correct asap.	Customer

29726	N/A	If I pay the full amount by check, how will the taxes I have already paid on the amount be restored to me? Will the deduction of $49k or the payment of that debt still show up in my W2s? If I choose to pay it from my bimonthly paycheck, can I use BAS/BAH to pay it off as well? Will it pay it out from the pre-tax amount or post-tax amount? These questions are not addressed in the Debt Notification pdf, but play a huge role in deciding which option to choose and how much to ask DFAS to take out each pay period.	Customer

29851	N/A	The attachment was already provided in the original inquiry.  I spoke with DFAS and TSP and they all  advised that this needs to be handled through base level finance.	Customer
29852	N/A	MyPay is showing that as of 06/10/22 my TSP contributions will be over $30,000.  TSP is showing a contribution amount of $20,500 which now adds up to an almost $10K discrepancy.  As mentioned in my previous inquiry, I have spoke to TSP who referred me to DFAS.  DFAS concluded that I need to handle this with base level finance.  Inquiry response was "As we do not handle TSP here at base level. I would say that you would need to provide paperwork showing that you contributed more than what is showing on TSP for the CMS case. Once you attach that paperwork we will then submit the CMS case. If you have any other questions please let us know." - This was already provided in the original attachment (TSP MyPay Discrepancy.pdf).  I added 2 additional attachments - MyPay Website.pdf (This shows total TSP contribution amount of $30,484.51) and Contribution Details - MyAccount.pdf (showing $20,500).  Please advise if these documents will suffice.  If not, please advise on the proper paperwork required (AF Forms, etc.).	Customer

29903	clarifying questions on how to fill out Debt Form for DFAS	I wanted to pull out a couple of questions so they don't get lost in the numerous inquiries/messages already exchanged&#58; -If I pay the full $49k by check, how will the taxes I have already paid on the amount be restored to me? Will the deduction of $49k or the payment of that debt still show up in my W2s so my annual income does NOT appear to be $49k over normal? If not, then I don't want to pay by check.-If I choose to pay it from my bimonthly paycheck, can I use BAS/BAH to pay it off as well? -Will it pay it out from the pre-tax amount or post-tax amount? Answers to these will help me calculate how much DFAS can deduct from each pay check, so I can request the right amount in that Debt form (since I would like to max out how much they can take back each pay period).  Thank you	Customer

29906	Reopened	I am awaiting a copy of the settlement voucher but per conversation with Tech, only federal taxes were computed for the RITA claim. State taxes should also be factored into the RITA claim IAW US Title 41 (Code of Federal Regulations) for RITA claims. If needed, I can provide an extract of US Title 41 about the calculation used to factor state taxes for the RITA claim. By my calculations, over $1,738 were charged by the State of Georgia from the $30,228.02 of travel income as stated on my Travel W2s. I can also provide the GA state income tax table, if needed.

30072	Reopened	I initially submitted for my BRS bonus payment in March 2021 and have beenfollowing up on it regularly for over a year now. Initially I was told DFASwas way behind, that a CMS case had been submitted, and it would get paidout soon. After CSP came out, I submitted a ticket which sat there with atechnician for a few months and my follow up messages were ignored. When Ifinally stopped in, I spoke to Jordan who told me he submitted a CMS caseand I got the case number so I could follow it. I'm not sure if I was liedto about the previous CMS case being submitted or if it was closed out forlack of action. Since then I've called DFAS and AFPC a few times as I tracked the CMS case.About a month ago, DFAS told me I would have to check with my pay office asit was assigned to them for action. I stopped by and was told by one of theguys that it would be pushed back to DFAS as the pay office could not issuepayments. After seeing it was pushed back and a few more weeks went bywithout payment, I called DFAS again and the representative listed off theitems in the comments that DFAS was requesting. I wrote them down and wentback to the pay office and spoke to Jordan again who assured me that hefound out it was just a spreadsheet that needed to be filled out and wouldbe submitted right then and I should get paid within a few weeks. A fewweeks have gone by and I still have not received my bonus so I called DFASagain and was surprised to hear that there had been no further action on thecase and they did not receive the documents.I have provided another copy of my BRS election SOU to this email along withsome previous email traffic. Please give me a call at 440-321-6331 so I can provide any additionalinformation needed to get this resolved.	Customer
30073	N/A	based on the number of LESs, it appears 2021 tax is getting refunded 1 at a time, so at some point that should close the gap in the pre-tax vs post-tax debt amount. -Since the debt has already been un-suspended despite not filling out that Debt Notification letter, is there a point to submitting the letter anymore? The rate of 2/3  is acceptable because it will allow me to resume TSP contributions.	Customer

I believe I need to request from you, 452d, an Accounts Payable printout, along with either a Payment Agreement Number or Wage Garnishment number, and then I can pay online to speed up processing. Paying by mail could take many weeks to process. Please let me know if you can provide this printout with this information to facilitate me paying off the remaining debt online. Thank you. here's the link to the online way I'm talking about&#58; https&#58;//www.pay.gov/public/form/start/16531440 According to DFAS, there is also a QR code you can provide so that I can scan and pay back from the DFAS app.	Customer

30184	Resolved	Please see below has your HOR been updated in MILPDS. This is where the HOR for Arows-r comes from. An order cannot be MOD'd for BAH Rate purposes. There also must be atleast a one day break or a members orders must become a PCS in order to update your BAH rate. b) Home of Record (HOR).1. A member should never change their HOR for BAH purposes. An RC member who changes their HOR during an order, is also changing their return/release to location.a. A member on a TDY order receives BAH based on their HOR location, but may also be entitled to Per Diem.2. When an RC member is released from Active Duty, they are released to their HOR.a. HOR changes occur when there is at least a one day break in Active Duty status.	AFRC Military Pay Technician

30197	94FM updated my tax information IAW pay packet received on 14JAN2022. is there a reason they didn't update my address for BAH purposes?	To be clear I did NOT &quot;change my HOR for BAH purposes.&quot; BAH just happens to be the current issue. I changed my HOR because I separated from active duty and moved during terminal leave to a new location; I updated my HOR accordingly. What I am telling you is that 94FM didn't update my address IAW the AF Form1745 I sent to Mr. Jordan Moss on 14 Jan 2022Bottom line is you 94FM managed to update my tax information received in the attached packet but not my address for pay purposes. Please be reasonable - there is no other means by which you could have updated my tax information, the address change for pay purposes is plainly stated on the signed AF Form 1745.The address tied to my MilPay is New York City IAW with the AF Form 1745 94FM received on 14JAN2022.According to the AF From1745 the &quot;Principal Purposes&quot; of the form is &quot;To permit address changed for the Joint Uniform Pay System (JUMPS) , the Retired Pay Systems the Reserve component pay systems, and the civilian pay systems to maintain a record of current address for pay related matters and bonds.&quot; Please explain to me how that form is NOT related to a change of address for pay related items.v/r,CPT|DRR	Customer

30213	Apartment Lodging	G. Reimbursement for Commercial Lodging, Government Quarters, Other LodgingArrangements, and Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses. When a traveler procures long-term lodging,on a weekly or monthly basis, the AO computes the daily TDY lodging costs by dividing the total lodgingcost for the period by the number of days the traveler is authorized the lodging portion of the locality perdiem rate (see long-term TDY computation example 1). Expense items that do not accrue on a daily basisare averaged over the number of days the traveler is authorized per diem during the TDY. The AOincludes the following costs in determining the long-term lodging cost&#58;1. Utility connection, use, and disconnection.2. Dumping.3. Showers.4. Cleaning or maid fees.5. Cable TV.6. Automobile head bolt heaters, if ordinarily included in the hotel or motel rate in the areaconcerned.7. Monthly local telephone use. Monthly fees does not include installation charges,unofficial long-distance calls, or monthly fees for a personally owned mobile phone when used instead ofan installed phone for official communications.9. Appropriate and necessary furniture rental.10. Exchange fees involved in renting time-share lodging at the TDY point, but not theannual maintenance fee.11. Rental furniture or appliances. No reimbursement is authorized for items that arecontracted or rented with the option to buy unless there is no other alternative. If an “option-to-buy” planis used, the traveler must reimburse the Government the amount credited toward the purchase if paid aspart of the travel claim settlement. If a damage-waiver fee is required as part of the cost, the traveler maybe reimbursed for the fee as part of the furniture rental (CBCA 1961-TRAV, July 20, 2010). A travelercannot be reimbursed for shipment or purchase of furniture (GSBCA 16699-TRAV, August 17, 2005).	AFRC Travel Pay Manager
