Description	Answer
Will I need to do anything for my last payout for my reenlistment bonus? I reenlisted under zone B and I got 75% upfront. I was told I would get the remaining 25% at my 1 year mark.	You need to ensure your contract has been fully completed by FSS/MPS. Once Personnel loads the bonus information the data is sent straight to DFAS for payment release.
I have a travel voucher that has been signed pending approval for more than 2 weeks. Who can I contact to inquire about this?	
Do you accept SmartVouchers from DFAS? I have a member filing a paper voucher from a PCS and would like to use this function--thank you!	We do not accept this form at this time. However, our in-person in-processing has streamlined the format to ask you the questions needed once (Name, rank, key dates, etc.) and pre-populate across all forms for PCS voucher and station gain actions CPTS needs to process. This yields next day turn-arounds typically for updating not only your PCS move reimbursement documents to AFFSC for final payment, but also your BAH.
Is inprocessing still at 1230 on Thursdays?	
To clarify the traveler must put the actual location of the temporary duty, not the city or area.	DoD 7000.14-R (DoDFMR), Volume 9, Chapter 5, para 0503, “To ensure proper reimbursement, the actual TDY duty location must be listed on the travel orders (i.e., if going TDY to Ft. Bliss, TX, the travel orders must explicitly state “Ft. Bliss, TX” not “El Paso, TX”).”
Is there a new GPC homepage link under usaf.dps.mil?	
I just returned from my deployment, how do I file my voucher?	"Financial Ops has paused the in person reintegration briefs. However, our DTS team is able to assist through CSP.
 Forms can be found through the Knowledge Base- Deployment Corner (list below). Once you have completed the documents and have all of the required receipts, submit a inquiry with all documentation. Our team will review. If all documents are complete and signed, the tech will ""T-enter"" your voucher in DTS. If not, the tech will be in touch to advise on corrections. Be sure to check the status of your inquiry, the tech will provide updates in the inquiry. Inquiries will be closed after 5 days if no response is provided."
My name is A1C Mendez-Ramos. I am new at McGuire Afb and submitted my paperwork need for the inprocessing. When I am going to received my first BAH payment?	"Greetings,
 
 
 You will start receiving JBMDL's BAH once the transaction to gain you to the base has posted to your military pay record. This usually happens within 2 pay periods after you have filed your voucher. If two pay checks have passed and you have not seen the correct BAH, create an inquiry and the team will look into it

I am coming up on a PCS and I need to be signed off on vMPF.	If you are PCSing out of Minot (not retiring or separating), you will need to submit a copy of your orders/amendments and provide us your projected date of departure. You can submit a 'Military Pay' inquiry 30 days prior to your projected date of departure..
My spouse and I are both stationed in Minot AFB. Do we both get with dependent rate for our newborn?	No, only one military member may claim the new dependent. The claiming member will then receive with dependent rate BAH, while the other will receive the without dependent rate.
I am coming back from a deployment/TDY and I would like to claim FSA.	You can claim FSA by filling out a DD 1531 (boxes 1-9b, 10a). Please make sure that you completed a voucher and it is on 'APPROVED' status. Create a 'Military Pay' inquiry.
"Hi, inquiring about a TSP note that has been approved for temporary suspension due to COVID-19. It has been 2 full pay periods and haven't seen the suspension on mypay stub.

 Please look into this matter and if more information is required, let me know as soon as possible.

 Thank you!"	"This feature currently does not exist. However, you can either 
 1) adjust your profile PASCODE to the base you want to route the AF3821 to, this would be challenging to follow up on if you made a mistake or what to refresh to check the status as you'd have to change each time and refresh CSP. 
 2) Submit on behalf of other using another Category and the member's info which if their profile is built with a PASCODE that matches their supporting CPTS the inquiry will route appropriately. I'd ask to be added as a Team Member on those inquiries so you can track the status.

"Good Morning,
 
 
 What is the plan on how the tax deferment will be repaid? Will there be some type of payment plan, automatic garnishing of wages, or will members be able to pay extra each month to offset it? Please advise and thank you.

 MSgt Nixon"	"The current method as described is the rate will be turned back on for 1 Jan pay meaning mid-month Jan and EOM Jan (paid on 1 Feb) would reflect the ~6.3% rate PLUS an additional 6.3% make-up for these few months the payments were deferred.
 
 
 If legislation passes then no collection will be made. As we approach December I anticipate hearing more on the specific tactics.

 BLUF: The vast majority of personnel on GAFB will be affected by a payroll tax deferment starting with their next paycheck. The extra money we will get over the next few months will be paid back next year. Please ensure your Airmen are tracking to prevent financial strain in the future. 
 
 Per 17 FSS, The Airman & Family Readiness Center (Bldg. 145) is ready to assist with any financial readiness questions per the tax deferral or any other financial matter. Please feel free to contact them at 654-3893 or emailfsc.programs@us.af.mil (Monday – Friday from 0800-1600) for more information or to make an appointment.
 
 Background: This is a “deferral” of taxes (not free/additional money) and members will have to pay this “deferred” tax back. Federal workers do not have the option to “opt-out” of having the tax deferred. The best way to know how it will affect you is to check your LES. More information is expected on how the deferred taxes will be recouped in 2021.

 Comm: (325) 654-5181
 DSN: 477-5181"	"In response to the Presidential Memorandum issued on August 8, 2020 (https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster), and the Department of the Treasury/IRS guidance issued August 28, 2020, below is the information we received regarding the planned implementation of the deferred payroll tax. 
 
 DFAS will implement system changes to defer employees’ withholding of 6.2% of social security wages for those employees under the wages threshold and subject to social security tax. In addition, DFAS is planning on sending a SMARTDOC to all employees – both civilian and military members next week.
 
 Partnering with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), DFAS will implement the guidance according to the expectation that all Federal Civilian Payroll Providers will act in unison. OMB directed all Executive Branch Agencies to implement the deferral. This change will be made for both Civilians and the Military. As such, no Payroll Providers, Departments/Agencies, nor employees will be able to opt-in/opt-out of the deferral. The elimination of the withholding of employee deductions for the applicable employees will be effective the second paycheck in September, pay period ending September 12, 2020, that pays out September 18th. For the military members it will be effective with the mid-month that pays out September 15th.
 
 DFAS will defer the Social Security (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance or OASDI) employee deductions for all employees whose gross social security wages that are less than $4,000 in any given pay period through the end of 2020 (for military members this is calculated on monthly rate of basic pay that is less than $8,666.66 in any given month). Applicability will be determined on a pay period-by-pay period basis and could vary according to the wages subject to OASDI withholding. The deferral will not impact those employees in Retirement Plans not subject to Social Security withholding (i.e. CSRS).
 
 
 Please be advised that the IRS guidance advises that the deferred amount of OASDI tax be collected between January 1-April 30, 2021, more information to come from DFAS on exactly how collection will occur. The IRS is still working to determine how the deferral and collection will impact employees’ W-2s. Employees should be made aware that the temporary deferral of the 6.2% OASDI withholding does not eliminate them from being liable for the tax should they depart from Federal Civilian Employment."

 Relief with Respect to Employment Tax Deadlines Applicable to Employers Affected by the Ongoing Coronavirus (COVID-19) Disease 2019 Pandemic
  
 Notice 2020-65
 On August 8, 2020, the President of the United States issued a Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) to use his authority pursuant to section 7508A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to defer the withholding, deposit, and payment of certain payroll tax obligations. Accordingly, the Secretary has determined that employers that are required to withhold and pay the employee share of social security tax under section 3102(a) or the railroad retirement tax equivalent under section 3202(a) are affected by the COVID-19 emergency for purposes of the relief described in the Presidential Memorandum and this notice (Affected Taxpayers). For Affected Taxpayers, the due date for the withholding and payment of the tax imposed by section 3101(a), and so much of the tax imposed by section 3201 as is attributable to the rate in effect under section 3101(a), on Applicable Wages, as defined herein, (collectively Applicable Taxes) is postponed until the period beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending on April 30, 2021.
 
  
 Applicable Wages
 For purposes of this notice, Applicable Wages means wages as defined in section 3121(a) or compensation as defined in section 3231(e) paid to an employee on a pay date during the period beginning on September 1, 2020, and ending on December 31, 2020, but only if the amount of such wages or compensation paid for a bi-weekly pay period is less than the threshold amount of $4,000, or the equivalent threshold amount with respect to other pay periods. The determination of Applicable Wages is made on a pay period-by-pay period basis. If the amount of wages or compensation payable to an employee for a pay period is less than the corresponding pay period threshold amount, then that amount is considered Applicable Wages for the pay period, and the relief provided in this notice applies to those wages or that compensation paid to that employee for that pay period, irrespective of the amount of wages or compensation paid to the employee for other pay periods.
 
 Payment of Deferred Applicable Taxes
 
 An Affected Taxpayer must withhold and pay the total Applicable Taxes that the Affected Taxpayer deferred under this notice ratably from wages and compensation paid between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021 or interest, penalties, and additions to tax will begin to accrue on May 1, 2021, with respect to any unpaid Applicable Taxes. If necessary, the Affected Taxpayer may make arrangements to otherwise collect the total Applicable Taxes from the employee."	"Question 1: Why are my Social Security taxes being deferred? 
  
 Answer: In order to provide relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, a Presidential Memorandum was issued on August 8, 2020, and guidance followed by Internal Revenue Service on August 28, 2020, to temporarily defer Social Security (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)), as seen on the Army, Air Force, and Navy Service Members Leave and Earnings Statement as “FICA-SOC SECURITY”) tax withholdings. The Social Security tax is labeled as “Social Security” on the LES for the Marine Corps.
 
 Presidential Memorandum link: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/13/2020-17899/deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-in-light-of-the-ongoing-covid-19-disaster
 
 Question 2: What is the Social Security tax?
  
 Answer: Social Security tax is also called the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) tax and is required by law. The tax funds the Social Security program, which is administered by the Social Security Administration. 
 
 Question 3: Where are the Social Security taxes shown on my LES?
  
 Answer: The Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) for the Air Force, Army and Navy member list the Social Security taxes as “FICA-SOC SECURITY” within the deductions section. For the Marine Corps this deduction is listed as “Social Security” on the LES.
 
 Question 4: How is the Social Security tax calculated?
  
 Answer: The Social Security tax is set by at law at 6.2%. The tax is calculated as 6.2% of a military member’s basic pay. For example, an E5 with 8 years of service has a monthly basic pay rate of $3,306.30. Assuming the E5 was paid for the whole month of duty, the monthly Social Security tax liability would be calculated at 6.2% of $3,306.30, which equals $204.99. Members can use their August or prior Leave and Earnings Statements as a good reference for their typical Social Security tax withholding amount. 
 
 Question 5: Can I opt-out of the deferred Social Security tax withholding? 
  
 Answer: No. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed all Executive Branch Agencies to implement the tax deferral. As such, no Payroll Providers, Departments/Agencies, or service members will be able to opt-in/opt-out of the deferral. 
 
 Question 6: Does this affect any of my other tax withholdings?
  
 Answer: No. Pursuant to the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service Guidance, this only affects your Social Security tax withholdings, which will be deferred from September 2020 through the end of the calendar year 2020.
 
 Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service guidance link: 
 https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-20-65.pdf 
 
 Question 7: What is the wage limit amount for determining who will have their Social Security tax withholdings deferred through the end of calendar year 2020? 
  
 Answer: If your monthly rate of basic pay is less than $8,666.66, your Social Security taxes will be deferred. If your monthly rate of basic pay is at or above the threshold, your social security tax withholding will not be affected by this temporary deferral. 
 
 The monthly rate of $8,666.66 is determined as: 
 
 The IRS rate of $4,000 is based on a bi-weekly pay schedule (26 pay periods), while your military pay is calculated on a monthly pay schedule (12 months). To convert the bi-weekly rate of $4,000 to monthly, multiply $4,000 X 26 (pay periods) = $104,000 and divide by 12 (months), which will equal $8,666.66 for the monthly rate. 
 
 Question 8: What grades are impacted? 
  
 Answer: 
 • Enlisted service members will have their Social Security taxes deferred. 
 • Officers at the grade O1-O4, the grade of O5 with less than 16 years of service, and the grade of O6 with less than 14 years of service will have their Social Security taxes deferred.
 • All officers at the grade of 05 with 16 or more years of service, grade of O6 with 14 or more years of service, and all O7s through O10s will not have their Social Security taxes deferred. 
 • All warrant officers will have their Social Security taxes deferred except those at a grade of W5 with 24 or more years of service. 
 
 Question 9: Will I be required to pay back the Social Security taxes that are deferred? 
  
 Answer: Yes. Current IRS guidance indicates the payment of the deferred taxes is postponed until January 1, 2021. The deferred Social Security taxes not withheld from wages during 2020 will be collected from your wages between January 1, 2021, and April 30, 2021. Additional information on the collection process will be provided in the future.
 
 Question 10: How much will my payroll provider collect during each pay period starting in January 1, 2021 through April 30, 2021?
  
 Answer: As more information becomes available on the collection of the deferred Social Security taxes, it will be posted here. 
 
 Question 11: Can the deferred Social Security tax liability be waived or forgiven? 
  
 Answer: Only Congress has the authority to forgive taxes. Deferral of the Social Security tax only postpones when the taxes are due. 
 
 Question 12: Can I select my repayment terms, by lump sum or evenly?
  
 Answer: Pursuant to current Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service Guidance, total deferred Social Security taxes must be withheld evenly from wages beginning January 1, 2001, and ending on April 30, 2021. As more information becomes available on the collection of the deferred Social Security taxes, it will be posted here. 
 
 Question 13: Do I have to pay interest and penalties if not paid after April 2021?
  
 Answer: As more information becomes available on the application of interest and penalties, it will be posted here. 
 
 Question 14: I am separating from the service before the end of this year; will I be required to pay it back? 
  
 Answer: If you separate or retire in 2020 before the Social Security tax can be collected in 2021, you are still responsible for the Social Security tax repayment. As more information becomes available on the collection of any deferred Social Security taxes, it will be posted here. 
 
 Question 15: How will this affect my 2020 and 2021 W-2? 
  
 Answer: As more information and guidance becomes available from the Internal Revenue Service on how the deferral and collections affect your 2020 and 2021 W-2s, it will be posted here. 
 
 Question 16: When will the payroll tax deferral begin? 
  
 Answer: The deferral of the withholding of the Social Security tax for service members will be effective for mid-month pay September."

What PCS travel allowances are authorized.	"Per diem: You are authorized 100% of the standard CONUS per diem rate (currently $151), which includes Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE). You are also authorized Lodging Plus for flying and TDY, and/or MALT Plus for POC Travel.

"· MILPAY Active Component: Begin collections as planned with mid-month January and collect in even amounts over 24 increments (12 Mid-Month and 12 End of Month collections)
 
 
 · MILPAY Reserve Component: Begin collections with the mid-month disbursement vs. the first pay run of the month to be in alignment with Active Component and to ensure time for programming and testing in advance of collections.

  A1: DFAS will establish the collection rate for the 12 month collection period. There will be a difference between DJMS-AC and DJMS-RC collections. Given that members paid out of DJMS-RC have intermittent duty schedules, it was not feasible to split the deferred amount by equal dollar amounts, as some members will not be on consistent duty through the collection period. Debts will be set up in both DJMS-AC and DJMS-RC to collect the deferred OASDI, with LES remarks updating the debt balance through the collection period. DJMS-AC debts created will divide the deferred collections evenly among the 24 pay periods. DJMS-RC debts created will collect at a rate of 2% of net pay (vs the 6% originally planned when the collection period was 4 months). 
 
 A2: No, does not apply to collection of taxes. We are using debt FIDs and TINs in the pay system as a mechanism to collect the deferred tax amounts. It was the most feasible way that we could accomplish within the pay system to allow for tracking and reporting.
 A3: No, with the volume of members with taxes deferred, adding this option would present too much risk.
 A4: For members separating in 2020 (during the deferral period), the debts will be established as Out of Service debts and collected through our Debt & Claims Management Office. For members separating in 2021, the remainder of the uncollected deferred amount will be collected from final pay. Any residual amount will be set up as an Out of Service debt."

"Q1: What kinds of costs are included as in-kind benefits to employees during PCS government funded moves?
  A1: Please refer to the document included labeled, ""PAG Civ Employee HHG Tax Debt"" for what was taxable before TCJA 2017 and what was added under TCJA on 1 Jan 2018.
   
   
  Q2: How many civilians are impacted for the 2020 tax year?
  A2: We had 1,258 civilian PCS moves in 202 as compared to 1,800 civilian PCS moves in 2019.
   
  Q3: Have the affected employees been notified? If not, when and how?
  A3: They will be notified in December via email.
   
  Q4: Can taxes associated with HHG income be taken out of PCS travel payments when employees file the travel vouchers?
  A4: No, the PCS voucher is filed at in-processing and the HHG costs are not available at that time.
   
  Q5: Will affected employees receive end-of-year W2s that show the income and taxes paid?
  A5: Yes, affected employees will receive a travel W-2 at the end of the year that will include the increase in gross income and taxes for all PCS-related vouchers filed and HHGs. Tax year 2020 W-2s will be mailed to employees and also available through myPay by the end of January.
   
  Q6: Can civilians file RITA claims to recover the additional tax levied against them?
  A6: Yes, civilians are encouraged to file their RITA voucher after they file their annual tax return. Note: This is not a 100-percent dollar for dollar offset as each individual’s tax situation is unique.
   
  Q7: Should employees wait for their RITA claims to be resolved before beginning to pay back the Air Force?
  A7: No, suspending the repayment of the indebtedness is not an option. The employee can establish the repayment plan and make the required payments and then once the RITA voucher is settled the employee can make a lump sum payment to pay off the debt.
   
  Q8: If the Act took effect in 2017, how were civilians who PCS’d impacted during 2018 and 2019?
  A8: In 2018 and 2019, civilians who had HHG taxes due had to pay them direct to the IRS. This may have included any interest and penalties the IRS applies to debts. This new Air Force plan ensures employees are not charged interest and penalties
   
  Q9: Is there a possibility for the Air Force to cancel the debt?
  A9: No, the Air Force doesn’t have the authority to waive a tax debt.
   
  Q10: Why did the Air Force delay reporting HHG income and taxes to the IRS in 2018 and 2019?
  A10: Due to the law change taking place in December 2017, DoD did not have a way to capture the costs and report them. This was a DoD problem in 2018 and 2019.
   
  Q11: Does the OASDI deferral impact this situation?
  A11: No, the OASDI is based on an employee’s base pay for taxes, so it’s not part of the OASDI deferral act.

The regulation has changed on this subject. Prior to the DAFMAN 65-601 being established, chapter 10 of AFI 65 601 allowed for commanders, chiefs or first sergeants to attend PME graduation ceremonies in a funded TDY status. AFI 65-601 was rewritten and scaled down and was replaced with the DAFMAN 65-601. Chapters 5 and 11 of DAFMAN 65-601 provides guidance on funded TDY travel. PME graduation ceremonies (or any formal training graduations) are no longer among the ceremonies that members may travel in a funded TDY status. The authorization to attend in a permissive TDY status (unfunded) may still exist in the 36-3003, but this category of travel is no longer funded.	BLUF: Funded travel to graduation ceremonies are no longer authorized
"BACKGROUND: During the FSO Worldwide FM Training Workshop, it was brought up that many of the Rental Car companies are charging an “Age Fee” upon rental of the vehicle. This fee could be shown and included on the rental car receipt.
 
 
 DTMO requests that any traveler who is incorrectly charged this age fee submit a request for assistance and supporting documentation through the Rental Vehicle Assistance. To submit a request for assistance, a traveler should click “Report an Accident” on the right side of this page:https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/rentalCar.cfm. DTMO is also working to revise the language on this page to make it clearer that the Rental Vehicle Assistance Tool can also be used to correct vendor overcharges such as the kind you identified. Please ensure to include the TANUM and copy of the legible rental car receipt, not the agreement form provided by the rental car company."	BLUF: Any vendor location that participates in the U.S. Government Rental Car Program should not charge DOD travelers a young driver fee, an underage fee, or any other fee for authorized drivers as dictated by the U.S. Government Rental Car Agreement.
Are Service Members and Civilian Employees exempt from hotel or occupancy taxes?	Several states and cities have exempted Service members and civilian employees from paying a hotel occupancy tax when certain requirements are met. For more information and a list of locations offering tax exemptions, please visit theGSA website or access the GSA list from the DTMO website by clicking on State Tax Exemption Listings.
Can I pull out cash from an ATM while TDY?	"DoDI 5154.31V4:
 
 
 Travelers may use their travel card at ATMs to obtain cash needed to pay for “out-of-pocket” travel related expenses. Valid “out-of-pocket” travel related expenses are those that cannot be charged on the travel card (see section 040603 for examples).
 
 
 Expenses, including meals, incurred at a vendor that does not accept the travel card, such as government dining facilities, coin-operated parking meters, toll booths, laundry facilities, official local and long distance phone calls, etc. are exempt from the mandatory use of the travel card (IBA). However, since cardholders are required to use the travel card for all official travel related expenses, they should withdraw cash from an ATM to pay for these expenses, where practicable."
If I was TDY and lodged on base in Gov’t Qtrs, on orders, for under 30 days and have to E-certify, do I mark “in Gov’t Qtrs” on the E-certification?	No. You are not considered in “Gov’t Qtrs” when TDY. Always mark “NOT in Gov’t Qtrs” to ensure your BAH is paid correctly.
What is the standard processing procedures for service members when dealing with 988's Leave Charge Forms?	"Prior to taking your leave, you will first fill out the 988 Part 1, which will be signed by yourself and your supervisor. This must be turned into the CPTF to acquire a Leave Authorization Number prior to the start of your leave.
 
 
 When you return from leave, you will complete the 988 Part 3, which will annotate if no or any changes will be made to the original Part 1 request. Once signed by yourself and your supervisor, this will be turned into the CPTF who will take the Part 1 and Part 3 combined to finally charge your account the proper leave taken. 
 
 
 The Part 2 is for your own personal records to keep track of leave used in case there is a lag in the system or if your leave charge has been delayed."
How much time do I have as the Service Member to sign and submit my DTS voucher when I return from my TDY?	"You have 5 days from the time you return from your trip to submit your travel voucher. If you do not signed your voucher within 5 days, you will show up on a report that is worked monthly. These reports are then sent to the supervisor and leadership distro email inboxes for follow up and to take action as needed. 
 
 
 
 
 Reference:
 DoDFMR 7000.14-R Volume 9:
 4.5.1. General. When a travel advance is authorized, it must be monitored to ensure that a corresponding travel claim is filed within 5 working days of the traveler’s return to or arrival at the permanent duty station (PDS), or immediately when the orders are canceled. Travelers whose TDY extends beyond 30 days may file travel claims within 5 working days after the end of every 30 calendar day period or travel accrual payments may be provided in accordance with service-specific regulations.
 
 
 4.5.2.2. Other Travelers. Each DoD Component must ensure that it has a process to monitor travelers’ advances. Issue a letter advising travelers of his or her responsibility to submit travel claims and/or repay advances. On the 46th day after the traveler’s estimated date of return/arrival, if no response to the letter has been received, then collect from the traveler’s pay account."
What is the standard AROWS E-Certification process?	"There are a few processes for e-certification:
 - For Short Tours (29 days or less), the service member will log into AROWS and sign the statement of duty on or after the last day of the order. 
 
 
 - For Long Tours (30 days or more) excluding BMT/NPS TTS/NPS MEST & Permanent AGR, the service member will sign the statement of duty on or after the first day of the order which will start the payment process.
 
 
 - For Long Tours for BMT, NPS TTS, and NPS MEST, e-certification is not required as most NPS members do not have access to the system or do not have a CAC to sign in and e-certify their orders for pay. The CPTF will continue to track these orders and we will work with BETM consistently to have Start Tour paperwork filled out; we will then process pay manually for the members. 
 
 
 - For Permanent AGR Orders, there is no e-certification allowed as these orders are processed in a different system entirely and manually gained and worked by the CPTF."

What is a valid receipt for a voucher?	"Valid receipts are required for airfare, lodging and expenses of $75 or more. DTMO has provided some helpful information to help travelers understand what constitutes a valid receipt. Paid TDY vouchers with invalid receipts are being flagged by DFAS stating invalid receipts were submitted under expenses in DTS. These instances must be corrected. As a reminder, GTCC statements, flight itineraries, rental car reservation invoices and hotel reservations are not valid receipts.
 Travelers are advised to retain ALL receipts for tax or other purposes. DoD Financial Management Regulation, Vol 9, “Travel Policy,” requires an itemized receipt for each lodging expense, regardless of the amount, and any individual expenditure of $75 or more."

Understanding the difference between a Travel Authorization & Travel Voucher.	"An Authorization captures information regarding an upcoming TDY (locations, cost-estimates, travel information). Is a mean of informing everyone who needs to know the When, Where, and How’s of your trip. Authorizations should be build and fully approved prior to trip’s start date.
 Completing an Authorization Step by Step
 
 
 
 A Voucher is a claim for reimbursement of actual expenses you incurred and payment of allowances you earned while you were TDY. You will not be able to create a voucher on DTS without a fully approved Authorization.
 Completing a Voucher Step by Step"
LOAs will vary depending on the type of travel being performed.	Travelers should first check with the squadron’s ODTA before contacting Finance for DTS assistance.
Cross orgs are used when a member goes TDY for another unit who will pay for the travel.	The member must provide their SSN to their POC at the other unit. Only the owning unit can cross a member into their LOA.
When triggered on an authorization/voucher the DTS Constructed Travel pre-audit indicates that a constructed travel worksheet (CTW) may be required.	"A CTW is required when the traveler chooses a mode of transportation that differs from the standard. A CTW is not required if your trip meets one of the following conditions:
 1. You will use the transportation mode the AO will authorize or direct on every travel leg. The AO will
 Usually authorize or direct you to use commercial air, unless a local policy dictates otherwise.
 2. You will use your privately owned vehicle (POV) – automobile or motorcycle only – for every travel
 Leg that is 400 or fewer miles, per the Defense Table of Official Distance (DTOD).
 3. Government transportation is authorized or directed.
 CTW Worksheets"
Using another unit’s days in AROWS.	The other unit will not send their days to the 105th. The CSS will use the dropdown menu in AROWS when selecting days to choose the other unit’s resources. Contact FSS for specific guidance on creating orders in AROWS.
A member is on MPA days and will need to use MAJCOM travel funds.	If the MAJCOM is ACC or AMC, the first step is for the RA to submit the MAJCOM request form. The form is submitted to the budget office who will submit it to the MAJCOM for funding. The CSS will file the M4s in the M4’s folder: \\RSDQ-FS-001V\wing\Wing\Shared_Data\RA Budget Info\07 M4S Documents DO NOT DELETE. Once the funding is received, the LOA will be created and provided to the member. If the MAJCOM is not ACC or AMC, the member will receive the cross org from the MAJCOM providing the MPA days. The member will need to contact their POC at the MAJCOM and the CSS will file the M4s in the M4s folder.
The member is going on a TWCF mission and requires the TWCF LOA in DTS.	The CSS will file the M4s in the folder: \\RSDQ-FS-001V\wing\Wing\Shared_Data\RA Budget Info\07 M4S Documents DO NOT DELETE.  Once the M4s is filed, the CSS will send notification to the Budget Office via CSP that the M4s is filed and list the members needing the cross org.
A member needs access to a 105th LOA in DTS that is not under their own squadron.	The RA of the squadron will contact the Budget Office via CSP and provide the member’s SSN and name of the LOA needed.
The RA is approving authorizations/vouchers in DTS and needs to transfer funds between lines for the transaction to go through.	The RA will send a request to the Budget Office via CSP and state the amount to move from and to and the names of the LOA’s being affected.
Newly appointed RAs need to receive training from the budget office.	The RA will use the following link to request a date/time with the budget officer:Sign-Up Genius Link
A member’s DTS authorization/voucher was approved, but subsequently received an error code.	Notify the Budget Office via CSP with the name of the error, the order TANUM, travel dates, member’s name. The Budget Office will research the error code and submit a helpdesk ticket if needed.
The RA needs to make a supply purchase in ILS.	The RA will contact the Budget Office via CSP and state their RCCC, ILS ORG/PFMR numbers, amount of the budget load needed. If the RA does not have funds loaded to their legacy LOA, they will need to state that they need to also transfer funds from DEAMS to Legacy.
A squadron does not have enough AT days for projected training events and is requesting additional AT days/dollars.	The first step is for the squadron RA to contact the Group RA to request Group resources be re-distributed to the squadron in need. If the Group RA is able to complete the request with available Group resources, the Group RA will send a request to the Budget Office via CSP to transfer resources.
The RA has a member who has already completed 30 days of AT and needs additional training days.	The RA will complete the ST TV request form found in CSP and submit it to the Budget Office via CSP.
A member needs to come in for at least 4 hours of training outside of the RSD.	The RA will completed the IAD worksheet and submit it to the Budget Office via CSP. If the member does not have any RDs to complete, the Budget Office will load the ATP/RMP periods to the squadron’s AROWS line. If the member has not completed all RSDs, the RA will be notified to have the member complete all RSD periods before requesting additional IAD.
The RA is confused about the number of AT days received.	NGB does not send the unit 15 days of AT per DSG/DST. The unit must provide each member with 15 active military days which can be AGR, Temp AGR, AT, ST, School, MEST, BMT, ADOS, or MPA. It is the responsibility of the RA and CCMs to ensure that each member is afforded 15 active military days before other members receive additional active military days.
The RA has a possible mixing of appropriations concern.	If the situation falls into one of the exception to policy in AFMAN 65-01 the MAJCOM program manager can allow the member to remain on their days and use the squadron’s O&M TDY LOA in DTS.
The RA lacks one type of AT day but has plenty of another and wants to convert them.	No, we cannot convert officer/enlisted days locally. The first step is to see if another squadron within your Group can trade days with you. If not, the RA will send a request to the Budget Office for a conversion with NGB.
The CSS is not able to complete their RSD roster.	AROWS is an A1/FSS system. You must contact FSS for assistance with AROWS.
The RA needs UFR guidance.	Yes, you must obtain signatures from each area listed.
The RA needs UFR guidance.	No, you do not need to complete the UFR package for MILPERS resources. Submit your request for days/dollars to the Budget Office via CSP. Include a brief description/justification/mission impact along with need by date.
The RA has an issue with resources.	No, you cannot mix AT travel funds with special training dollars. Your type of days and WUC code must match to the type of dollars and ESP code.
Updating electronic funds transfer (EFT) information on DTS profile after a voucher has been submitted.	"Updating your personal EFT information on your DTS profile after a voucher has been fully processed will not change the information on the voucher. Your voucher will receive an “EFT RETURNED’ status or the funds will still be associated with your old account.
 In order to correct this you’ll have to update the information within the voucher by following the following steps: How to correct EFT Returns"
The Civilian pay technicians are able to gain new technicians into the pay system at base level as soon as HQ gains the new technicians at State level. This typically happens the second Wednesday of the pay period.	Typically, you will be paid within the same pay period you started. However, sometimes a new technician may be paid the second pay period after they started. If this is the case, you will be retro paid everything you were entitled to from the first pay period.
The TSP is a defined contribution plan, meaning that the retirement income you receive from your TSP account will depend on how much you (and your agency or service if you’re eligible to receive agency or service contributions) put into your account during your working years and your earnings over that period of time.	You can set up your TSP contributions on the TSP website at https://www.tsp.gov/
Technicians may be entitled to holiday pay, however; the technician is required to be in a pay status on their scheduled workdays either before or after a holiday.	Technicians are entitled to federal holiday pay on approved Federal Holidays. For ATAAPS purposes Holidays should be coded Holiday Leave (LH) hours. For hours in which a technician worked timecards should be coded one of the following HE, HF, HG, HS, or HT, but not HC.
Technicians performing military duty must be in a leave status from the technician program.	"Permanent technicians, and temporary technicians over 90 days are entitled to Military leave (LM) otherwise timecards should be coded Military Furlough (KG), LWOP -Leave without pay (KA), or other paid leave status.
 
 
 
 *It is important technicians are mindful of their timecards status while performing military duties. Receiving compensation in a paid status (i.e. RG, RF, RS, etc) is considered a dual compensation condition which is NOT authorized and could result in a debt."
Compensatory Time is time earned that can be used for hours paid at a later time.	"Yes, with supervisor approval, technicians are authorized compensatory time for hours worked in addition to their scheduled hours. Use code CE in ATAAPS.
 
 
 
 * Compensatory time must be used within one year from the date earned (26 pay periods) or the technician will forfeit it!"
Timecards can be entered in ATAAPS by the member and/or the Timekeeper.	Ultimately the member is responsible for ensuring their timecards are entered in ATAAPS prior to the close of the pay period. Timekeepers are available for assistance with time inputs and can answer your questions regarding type codes. In a member's absence, the Timekeepers may also complete them in ATAAPS.
Technicians accrue various types of leave over the course of their employment. However, only certain leave balances carryover when a technician transfers or comes back to the technician program.	You need to inform the Base CSR upon check in that you previously held a technician position. They will perform the steps of requesting your previous leave balances from DFAS to have them pulled over to your current record.
Technicians are authorized leave for birth events, adoptions and fostering under the FMLA.	Requests for eligibility approval must go through HRO. Please contact FSS to start the process. Once approved, the HRO will forward these documents to the CSR who will input the leave to your record.
Each base has a central coordinator for Civilian Pay matters.	The Base CSR (Customer Service Representative) is the first stop for questions and information relating specifically to your pay. Administrative questions should be directed to the FSS/HRO.

 Second, you are sometimes able to clear an error in the Leave Request screen by changing your 'From Time' and 'To Time' to even numbered hours.
 
 
 
 Third, ensure all fields with a red asterisk in the leave request are populated. 
 
 
 
 If you have tried these options and are still getting errors, contact the Finance office and ask for the technician pay CSR."
